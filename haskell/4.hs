-- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

-- Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

products = [ x * y | x <- [100..999], y <- [100..999] ] 

isPalindrome x = show x == (reverse $ show x)
